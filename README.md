Used the datset available on Dropbox ([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/v6epaau1kh7ofyj/AADOJsX-ghd70tn_ds1aDJtMa?dl=0))

Used the Google Colab notebook to create the model link to notebook is below (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SdEtYnlUdbE1IHHZ0lFNhjnufAoRGM47)

The model is capable of identifying RBC with a precision of 90.90%, WBC with a precision of 70%
